**Device Changelog 20.04.2025**

- Latest source changes
- March security patch (QPR1) ,HyperOS 2 based
- This build comes in two branches, each with different fingerprint implementations.

      Both versions can be flashed via local update through the system updater.

      Updater notification and auto-updates are only available on the Weekly Branch.

- Common Changes (Both Branches)

- Shake Gesture for Torch (early stage):
    → Works even with screen off (occasionally unresponsive).
    → Sensitivity is high on low slider values – increase the slider value for better accuracy.
- Turbo Charging Support with selectable max wattage:
    → Options: 33W / 45W / 60W / 90W.
    → Choose the max charging speed that suits your needs.
- Charging Control now works:
    → Set charging limit to 80% or above (below 80% not currently supported).

🟢 Weekly Branch
(Stock Kernel + Stock Fingerprint Sensor)

Uses stock fingerprint sensor (no real screen-off UDFPS).
Screen-off UDFPS via AOD hack:
 → Enable Settings > Gestures > Always-On Fingerprint.
 → Enabling Always-On Fingerprint:
Increases screen-off battery drain.
Prevents ambient notifications from showing.
→ Disable it if you want Always-On Display (AOD) to function.
→ Supports updater notifications & auto-updates.

🔵 OSS-FOS Branch
(Isis Kernel + OSS Fingerprint Sensor)

Uses OSS fingerprint HAL with Isis kernel (RK also supported).
Proper screen-off UDFPS support:
 → Enable Settings > Gestures > Long Press on Fingerprint Sensor to unlock.
Optional: Always-On Fingerprint (FP icon overlay like MIUI).
 → Increases screen-off drain + disables ambient notifications if enabled.
Touch sampling rate reduced to 333Hz.
❌ WARNING: Dead touch for FocalTech panel users!
 → Do NOT flash if your device has a FocalTech display panel.
